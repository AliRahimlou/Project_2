 # Project Litty Outline
- This web application will be a chat program similar to slack or skype. We will be using a variety of coding languages and libraries to create this project that have been accumulated through the course of the boot camp. This chat program will allow users to communicate with each other, send giphy inspired emojis. This will be less of an original design and more of a practice in building our own version of an existing product with our own slight twists as we go along.

## Goals 
There are three main goals that we capable of
- Using Socket.io we will create the basis of out chat application
- We will use sequelize to store the chat logs in mysql and ajax calls to update the website
- Finally using an API call to Giphy we will enable users to find and use gifs as emoji’s and store the most recently used ones in a database
### Target Audience
- This app will be targeted to Millennials and any others who appreciate good conversation and litty memes
### Messages
-	In the future this chat service will be able to integrate into other web applications allowing for multiple uses, from gaming to work enviroments.
### Competition
-	Discord, Slack and Microsoft teams are the main competition to this service.

####	Step 3 –(have this step complete by Sunday dec 8th)
*	Find how to store convo history in Socket.io to mysql
*	Begin integration of UI with javascript calls to giphy and Socket

####	Step 4 – at this point the base of the website will be complete and we can move to further challenges
*	Begin setup of authenticated users (browse for library’s or tech to assist we don’t have to build from scrap)
*	Allow for private chats, 1 on 1 or group (each new chat will need its own table)
